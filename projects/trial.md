# 🚀 Project Abstract Guide & Mini Project Ideas

## 🔹 What is an Abstract?

An **abstract** is a short summary of your **project idea**. It gives an overview that tells:

- What problem your project solves  
- What is your proposed solution  
- How it works  
- And the expected result or benefit

This helps any reader quickly understand what your project is about without going through the full details.

## 🔹 Example Abstract (in English):

**Title:** Smart Dustbin using IoT

**Abstract:**  
In today’s world, waste management is a major issue. Dustbins often overflow due to not being cleaned on time, resulting in an unhygienic environment. To solve this problem, we developed a **Smart Dustbin** using IoT (Internet of Things) technology.

This dustbin uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect how full it is and sends the data to a mobile app or web dashboard. This helps municipal workers identify which dustbins are full and clean them on time.

We have used components like Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a Wi-Fi module. The outcome of this project will be a more efficient waste management system and a cleaner environment.
