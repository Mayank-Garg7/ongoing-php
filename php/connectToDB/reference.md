before running the files you have to follow some of the steps let me tell which are these steps 
first create a folder 
search for xampp installation folder on your device 
most common paths:
windows is C:\xampp or C:\Program Files\xampp
macOS(xampp-vm): /application/xampp
Linux: /opt/lampp

Inside the XAMPP folder open htdocs.
Create a new folder named connectToDB.
after that you can create files inside that folder.
